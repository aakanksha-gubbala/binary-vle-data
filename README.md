# Analysis of Binary Isothermal VLE DATA

This web application reads data from DDBST's collection of VLE data for 30 important compounds.
Binary isothermal vapor-liquid equlibrium data of 30 Important Components from [Dortmund Data Bank](http://www.ddbst.com/en/EED/VLE/VLEindex.php) can be accessed from the web page. It plots grpahs of excess gibbs free energies, bubble pressures and vapor phase mol fractions. It also correlates the data with **Margules model**, **Redlich Kister** (truncated to two terms) and **van Laar model**.
