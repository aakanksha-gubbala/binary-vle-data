# Analysis of Binary Isothermal VLE DATA

This web application reads data from DDBST's collection of VLE data for 30 important compounds.
Binary vapor-liquid equlibrium data of 30 Important Components from [Dortmund Data Bank](http://www.ddbst.com/en/EED/VLE/VLEindex.php) can be accessed from the web page. It correlates the isothermal data with **Margules model**, **Redlich Kister** (truncated to two terms), **van Laar model** and **Wohls expansion** (truncated to one term).
